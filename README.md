## üîßStructure

#### Project has N-Tier Architecture:

| Layer                            | Assignment                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Controllers (Presentation layer) | Receives requests from the client, transmits them to the service layer, and returns JSON in response.                                            |
| Services (Application layer)     | Receives requests from the controller layer, transmits them to the DAO layer, <br/>receives a response from the DAO, and executes business logic |
| DAO (Data access layer)          | Receives requests from the service layer, transfers them to the database, and executes SQL queries                                               |

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Package Structure

- config - stores Spring configuration
- controller - contains controllers for endpoints
- dao - data access layer (repository) that calls CRUD methods in the database
- dto - wrapper for model objects to unify the requests and responses in controllers
- lib - contains email and password validators with its annotations
- model - contains models for the database
- service - contains services that call repositories, executes business logic
- mapper - converts model objects to DTO objects
